        <p class="mat-card-content">At InsightReactions, we are dedicated to making cutting-edge open-source AI
            technologies accessible to everyone while ensuring data privacy and eliminating costly
            subscriptions.
            Our mission is to simplify AI for home users by offering an affordable pre-configured AI home server
            and
            the <strong>completely free</strong> Tiny Llama service, enabling breathtaking image generation and
            intelligent conversations through Stable Diffusion and robust LLM chat interfaces similar to
            ChatGPT.</p>
        <p class="mat-card-content">Our development is guided by these <strong>Three Pillars:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Open Source Software:</strong> Harnessing the power of open source to drive innovation,
                empowerment, and accessibility, we offer free and effortless access to a well-maintained
                open-source
                platform of growing repository of cutting-edge AI technologies, including state-of-the-art
                image diffusion and large language models.</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy and Local Computing:</strong> Your privacy and data security are our top
                priorities.
                By promoting local computing, all data generated and used by the system stays on your device,
                ensuring complete control over your information. Our platform supports mDNS server
                auto-discovery,
                making it easy to access via your favorite mobile browser.</li>
            <li><strong>Accessibility and Affordability:</strong> We believe AI should be accessible to
                everyone,
                regardless of
                budget. Our Tiny Llama AI Home Server is an affordable, pre-configured Mini-ITX PC that allows
                users
                to host their own Tiny Llama service effortlessly and cost-effectively. It's designed for
                non-technical users familiar with generative AI technologies who prefer the privacy of local
                computing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mat-card-content">The Tiny Llama service includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pre-packaged AI WebUI software for seamless use on any device</li>
