		<p>While AUTOMATIC1111's Stable Diffusion WebUI is an incredibly powerful tool for generating digital media, one of its
			limitations is that it doesn't have a built-in feature to download new models from within its interface.
			However, this limitation can be easily overcome by leveraging SwarmUI's model downloader.</p>
		<h2 id="what-model-types-are-supported">What Model Types are Supported?</h2>
		<p>Models you download with SwarmUI using the model downloader will automatically become available in Stable
			Diffusion WebUI. The supported model types include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Model Checkpoints</li>
			<li>LoRAs (Low-Rank Adaptions)</li>
			<li>VAEs (Variational Autoencoders)</li>
		</ul>
