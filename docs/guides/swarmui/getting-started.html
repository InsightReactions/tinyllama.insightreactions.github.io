        <p>In this comprehensive guide, we will walk you through the fundamental principles and features of using
            SwarmUI, a versatile image generation interface. Additionally, we will delve into the core concepts of
            Stable Diffusion technology, which powers image creation.</p>
        <p>To begin, navigate to the <a href="http://tinyllama.local">tinyllama.local</a> landing page and access the SwarmUI service by clicking on the
            "SwarmUI" tab.</p>
        <h2 id="general-layout">Understanding General Layout and Features</h2>
        <p>Upon loading SwarmUI, you will be presented with a user-friendly interface featuring various tabs and
            settings. This guide aims to cover the essential aspects:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The top section contains different tabs, with the "Generate" tab being our primary focus.</li>
            <li>The left-hand region displays Stable Diffusion parameters, which can be expanded for further
                customization.</li>
            <li>The central region showcases the generated image output and prompt, accompanied by a "Generate" button.
            </li>
            <li>The right-hand region allows for batch image generation with a single click.</li>
            <li>The bottom section provides additional settings, including model selection and Image History, which can
                be used to refine your image creation process.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="basic-parameters">Understanding Basic Parameters</h2>
        <p>In this section, we will explore the fundamental parameters available in SwarmUI's left-hand pane.</p>
        <h3 id="core-parameters">Core Parameters and Settings</h3>
        <p>Locate the "Core Parameters" section and expand it for access to essential settings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Images: Specify the number of images to generate simultaneously.</li>
            <li>Seed: Utilize a random seed or manually specify one to achieve consistent image results. The Reuse
                button can be used to preserve the same seed for future generations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><img src="reuse_button.png" class="fitImage" alt="Seed buttons"></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Steps: Determine the number of times the Stable Diffusion model is executed for a given set of noise.
                Increasing steps can lead to improved image quality, but diminishing returns may occur at higher values.
            </li>
            <li>CFG Scale: Adjust the CFG scale to control how closely the model adheres to your prompt. A lower value
                encourages creativity, while a higher value enforces strict adherence.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="variation-seed">Variation Seed: Introducing Randomness to Images</h3>
        <p>Use the variation seed to introduce randomness to your image generation process. Enable the slider and
            specify a value for the Variation Seed Strength, within the recommended range of 0.1-0.5.</p>
        <p><img src="enable_slider.png" class="fitImage" alt="Enable Slider"></p>
        <h3 id="resolution">Image Resolution Options</h3>
        <p>Configure SwarmUI to generate images at specific resolutions by entering an exact pixel-by-pixel value or
            selecting a ratio. Some models may perform better with particular resolutions, but flexibility is generally
            maintained.</p>
        <h3 id="sampling">Sampling Methods for Image Generation</h3>
        <p>Samplers are a fundamental component of Stable Diffusion technology. Selecting the optimal sampler can
            significantly impact image quality and creativity. Consider the following options:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sampler: The default Euler Ancestral sampler is suitable for most use cases.</li>
            <li>Scheduler: Schedulers modify the behavior of the chosen sampler, and their usage is generally
                application-specific.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="other-parameters">Additional Parameters and Settings</h3>
        <p>The remaining basic parameters (Init Image, Refiner, ControlNet, and Video) are not addressed in this guide,
            but will be covered in more detail in separate guides.</p>
        <h2 id="available-models">Selecting the Optimal Stable Diffusion Model</h2>
        <p>SwarmUI offers two pre-trained models tailored for various image creation tasks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>CyberRealistic: A Stable Diffusion 1.5 model ideal for generating realistic images.</li>
            <li>DreamShaperXL: A Stable Diffusion XL model providing a wide range of art styles and creative
                possibilities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These models are based on different Stable Diffusion versions, with CyberRealistic (SD 1.5) being a faster
            option but with lower overall quality, and DreamShaperXL (SDXL) offering higher image quality at the cost of
            increased processing time. Fortunately, SwarmUI automatically adjusts settings for each model.</p>
        <h3 id="changing-the-model">Switching Between Models</h3>
        <p>To change your Stable Diffusion model, simply expand the model selection in the lower left-hand corner of the
            interface (pictured below).</p>

        <h2 id="generate-your-first-image">Generating Your First Image with SwarmUI</h2>
        <p>Now that you're familiar with the general layout and basic parameters, let's create your first image using
            SwarmUI. The default settings provided work fine for this example.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the center region, enter your Positive and Negative prompts in the text boxes. Place relevant details
                in the Positive prompt and unwanted elements in the Negative prompt. These will be prepended with "best
                quality" and "low quality," respectively, to guide the model towards optimal image creation.</li>
            <li>For this example, let's generate an image of a cat wearing a wizard hat. Type "cat wearing a wizard hat"
                after "best quality." Separate concepts in your prompt with commas.</li>
            <li>Click the Generate button to initiate image generation.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><img src="wizard_cat.png" class="fitImage" alt="Picture of a cat wearing a wizard hat"></p>
        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion: Mastering SwarmUI for Efficient Image Generation</h2>
        <p>Stable Diffusion technology and SwarmUI provide a powerful combination for image generation. This guide has
            covered the essential aspects, but there's more to explore. Feel free to ask questions by clicking the '?'
            button next to each setting for a brief description.</p>
