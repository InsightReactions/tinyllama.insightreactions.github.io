    <p>In this guide, we will discuss the refiner feature in SwarmUI, also known as image upscaling or "high-res fix."
      Refiners enable users to enhance image resolution without compromising on detail. By utilizing advanced algorithms
      and machine learning models, refiners can significantly improve image quality.</p>
    <p>We recommend that users familiarize themselves with the fundamentals of SwarmUI by reading our Getting Started
      guide prior to diving into this topic.</p>
    <h2 id="refiner-parameters">Refiner Parameters and Settings</h2>
    <p>The refiner feature is straightforward to use. Access the Refiner settings on the left-hand side of the
      interface.</p>

    </p>
    <p>The following parameters are crucial in optimizing image quality with refiners:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Refiner Model: This setting dictates which machine learning model to employ for image upscaling. We recommend
        using the default setting "(Use Base)" unless a specific reason warrants a different choice.</li>
      <li>Refiner Control Percentage: This parameter controls the extent to which the refiner influences the original
        image. A higher value indicates greater control, while a lower value suggests less intervention. Experimentation
        may be necessary to achieve optimal results.</li>
      <li>Refiner Method: The method of application is critical in determining the final image quality. We recommend
        using
        the default setting "PostApply," which applies the refiner after the original image has been generated. Other
        settings apply the refiner during the generation process, but may yield different results.</li>
      <li>Refiner Upscale: This parameter determines the degree of upscaling desired for the image. Common values range
        from 1.5x to 4x, although higher values can be used with caution due to potential resource constraints.</li>
      <li>Refiner Upscale Method: The upscale method employed by the refiner has a significant impact on image quality.
        We recommend using established methods such as "4x-UltraSharp" for optimal results.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="try-it-out">Practical Application: Upgrading Image Resolution</h2>
    <p>Let's demonstrate the practical application of refiners by upgrading an image. Here are some suggested
      parameters:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Refiner Model: (Use Base)</li>
      <li>Refiner Control Percentage: 0.4</li>
      <li>Refiner Method: PostApply</li>
      <li>Refiner Upscale: 2</li>
      <li>Refiner Upscale Method: 4xUltrasharp_4xUltrasharpV10.pt</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We have a sample image available for demonstration purposes:</p>
    <p><img class="fitImage" src="normal_image.png" alt="Original image before upscaling"></p>
    <p>With the refiner enabled and the specified parameters in place, hit Generate to initiate the upscaling process.
    </p>
    <p>The resulting image should demonstrate significant improvements in resolution:</p>

    <p>Now that is one fine-looking gentleman!</p>
