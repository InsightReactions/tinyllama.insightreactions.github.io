            <p>Llama3.1 is a formidable AI Code Assistant for its size, and is perfectly servicable in the role for most
                relatively popular programming languages. Luckily, Tiny Llama devices are configured to support this
                functionality out-of-the-box in the standard configuration!</p>

        <h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
        <p>To configure your personal computer, follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Open VSCode</strong>: Launch Visual Studio Code on your computer.</li>
            <li><strong>Install the &quot;Continue&quot; Extension</strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>Open the Extensions panel by going to File &gt; Preferences &gt; Extensions.</li>
                    <li>Search for and install the &quot;Continue&quot; extension.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Install Tiny Llama's default <code>config.json</code></strong>:
                <ul>
                    <li>Download <a href="config.json" class="download-link" download>config.json</a> and save it at
                        <code>&lt;HOME_DIR&gt;/.continue/config.json</code>.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Restart VSCode</strong>: Restart Visual Studio Code to ensure the configuration takes effect.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <aside class="info-card">
            <p>In this context, <code>&lt;HOME_DIR&gt;</code> refers to the user's home directory,
                which is typically the root directory of their personal files on their computer. The
                exact path can vary depending on the operating system:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>On Unix-like systems (e.g., Linux, macOS), it's usually
                    <code>/home/username</code>.
                </li>
                <li>On Windows, it's <code>C:\Users\username</code>.</li>
            </ul>
        </aside>
        <aside class="warning-card">
            <p>Having trouble connecting to the Tiny Llama service? Try these steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Check network access</strong>: Ensure that your system has a stable local area network
                    connection and can communicate with the Tiny Llama service.</li>
                <li><strong>Use your server's IP address</strong>: Issues with mDNS
                    domain resolution are still common for many personal computers. Try replacing all instances of
                    <code>tinyllama.local</code> in the provided <code>config.json</code> with the actual IP address of
                    your system hosting the Tiny Llama service (or Ollama for non-Tiny Llama users). Use the same IP
                    address that appears in the URL when navigating to a Tiny Llama service, like Open-WebUI.

        <h2 id="using-continue">Using Continue</h2>

        <h2 id="interactive-tutorials">Interactive Tutorials</h2>
        <img src="code-assistant-help.png" class="fitImage">
        <br />
        <p>To get started with Continue, follow these steps to access some useful resources:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Open the Command Palette</strong>: Open the VSCode Command Palette by pressing
                <code>CTRL-SHIFT-P</code> with VSCode in focus.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Search for &quot;Continue: Focus on View&quot;</strong>: Search for and select the
                &quot;Continue: Focus on View&quot; command.</li>
            <li><strong>View the Help Pane</strong>: Click on the question mark icon in the bottom right of the
                now-focused window to view the help pane.</li>
            <li><strong>Access the Resources</strong>: From here, you can see the Documentation, [interactive] Tutorial,
                Keyboard Shortcuts, and more.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="providing-chat-context">Providing Chat Context</h2>
        <img src="code-assistant-ctrl-l.png" class="fitImage">
        <br />
        <p>To get the most out of the Continue chat pane, you'll want to add specific sections of content that are
            relevant
            to your conversation. Here's how:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Highlight the region</strong>: Use your cursor to select the portion of content you'd like to
                work
                with.</li>
            <li><strong>Press <code>CTRL-L</code></strong>: This will allow you to add context from various files and
                include it in the chat pane.</li>
            <li><strong>Add as much detail as needed</strong>: Repeat this process until all relevant information is
                included in the Continue chat pane.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Alternatively, You can add relevant content manually using <a
                href="https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks" target="_blank">Markdown Fenced
                Code Blocks</a> or leverage <a href="https://docs.continue.dev/customization/context-providers"
                target="_blank">Continue's @ Context Provider</a> functionality to pull additional information.</p>
        <aside class="warning-card">
            Please note that you can quickly run out of context window space when including context -- opt for including
            precise snippets over including large sections of documents to avoid running out of room for an adequate
            response.
        </aside>
        <p>With your contextual snippets in place, you can take advantage of the full potential of the chat pane. Ask
            questions about the content itself, request revisions to the design or layout, or even convert content
            between languages - for example, from markdown to HTML, or English to Spanish. This powerful tool also
            serves as a personal editor for writing technical documents, formatting LaTeX, and more, making it an
            indispensable companion for any project.</p>

        <p>With Code Assistants, you can accelerate your development workflow by automating tasks like generating test
            data, writing entire functions, and even suggesting fixes for existing code. This feature lets you focus on
            what matters most â€“ building innovative solutions.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Editing Specific Regions</strong>: To edit a specific region of code, simply highlight it in
                your editor and press <code>CTRL-I</code>. A command drawer will then appear with an
                input field.</li>
            <li><strong>Inputting Changes</strong>: Enter your desired changes into the input field. You can add
                relevant content using markdown codeblocks or leverage <a
                    href="https://docs.continue.dev/customization/context-providers" target="_blank">Continue's @
                    Context Provider</a> functionality to pull additional information. When you're finished, press Enter
                to submit your request.</li>
            <li><strong>Reviewing and Applying Changes</strong>: The LLM will then review the highlighted region line by
                line, making the desired changes. Before applying the changes to the source file, you'll be given an
                opportunity to accept or reject them.</li>
