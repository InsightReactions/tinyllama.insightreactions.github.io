			</li>
			<li>
				Open a web browser of your choice on a device (desktop computer, laptop, or phone) and type
				<a class="external" href="http://tinyllama.local" target="_blank">tinyllama.local</a> in the URL
				bar and press Enter to access
				the Tiny Llama Local Dashboard. Feel free to bookmark this address; it is the primary method of

		</ol>
		<aside class="warning-card">
			The <a class="external" href="http://tinyllama.local" target="_blank">tinyllama.local</a> address
			will only work when connected to the same network as your Tiny Llama AI Home Server. If you are
			unable to access the dashboard, please ensure that both your device and the Tiny Llama AI Home
			Server
			are connected to the same local area network (LAN), and then try again.
		</aside>
		<aside class="warning-card">
			Please note that accessing the <a class="external" href="http://tinyllama.local"
				target="_blank">tinyllama.local</a> address
			is only possible from devices that support mDNS (Multicast DNS) resolution, which is not supported
			by all operating systems or network configurations. If you are unable to access the server using
			this method, you may try <a class="external" href="http://tinyllama">http://tinyllama</a>, or with
			the IP address of your Tiny Llama AI Home Server, which can be
			found in the user interface of your network router's administration panel. Please refer to your
			router's documentation for specific instructions on how to locate this information.
			<br /><br />
			Once you have the IP address, enter it into your web browser's URL bar and press Enter to access the
			Tiny Llama Local Dashboard.

		<aside class="warning-card">
			Wireless network connectivity with the Wi-Fi dongle requires additional configuration. To use the
			dongle, please
			connect a monitor, keyboard, and mouse to the server, power it on, login (password: tinyllama) and
			follow
			this <a class="external" href="https://linuxconfig.org/setup-wireless-interface-with-wpa-and-wpa2-on-ubuntu"
				target="_blank">Ubuntu Wi-Fi Setup Guide</a>.
			The use of the dedicated network cable is recommended to avoid network disconnections/disruptions.
