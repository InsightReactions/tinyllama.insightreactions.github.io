The Tiny Llama AI Home Server should be placed in a well-ventilated location, near a power outlet and network port.
1. Connect the power cable to the Tiny Llama AI Home Server (Figure 2).

3. Connect the corresponding ends of both cables to a power outlet and network port.

## Powering On and Connecting

1. Press the power button on the front of the Tiny Llama AI Home Server. Internal lights should illuminate, indicating power to the server. Please wait a few moments for the server to boot.
2. Open a web browser of your choice on a device (desktop computer, laptop, or phone) and type [tinyllama.local](http://tinyllama.local) in the URL bar and press Enter to access the Tiny Llama Local Dashboard. Feel free to bookmark this address; it is the primary method of accessing the tools offered by Tiny Llama.

{: .note }
The `tinyllama.local` address will only work when connected to the same network as your Tiny Llama AI Home Server. If you are unable to access the dashboard, please ensure that both your device and the Tiny Llama AI Home Server are connected to the same local area network (LAN), and then try again.

{: .note }
Accessing [tinyllama.local](http://tinyllama.local) is only possible from devices that support mDNS (Multicast DNS) resolution, which is not supported by all operating systems or network configurations. If you are unable to access the server using this method, try [http://tinyllama](http://tinyllama), or use the IP address of your Tiny Llama AI Home Server, which can be found in your router's administration panel. Please refer to your
router's documentation for specific instructions on how to locate this information. Once you have the IP address, enter it into your web browser's URL bar and press Enter to access the Tiny Llama Local Dashboard.

{: .warning }
Wireless network connectivity with the Wi-Fi dongle requires additional configuration. To use the dongle, please connect a monitor, keyboard, and mouse to the server, power it on, login (password: tinyllama), and follow this [Ubuntu Wi-Fi Setup Guide](https://linuxconfig.org/setup-wireless-interface-with-wpa-and-wpa2-on-ubuntu). The use of the dedicated network cable is recommended to avoid network disconnections/disruptions.

## Exploring the Tiny Llama Local Dashboard

Upon your first visit to [tinyllama.local](http://tinyllama.local) dashboard, you'll be greeted by an "Announcements and Updates" window. This window provides important information about new features and updates. It will only appear once, and then reappear when there are updates. Click or tap "Close" to dismiss this window.

The Tiny Llama Local Dashboard serves as the central hub for all the tools and services offered by Tiny Llama:

## Available AI Plugins
- **Amica:** Amica is an open-source interface that enables effortless interaction with 3D characters, powered by voice synthesis and speech recognition. Our platform makes it remarkably easy to set up lifelike 3D avatars in your world. With advanced features like seamless transcription, natural text-to-speech, expressive animations, and vision capabilities, Amica raises the standard for digital interactions.
- **Open WebUI:** This is an extensible, feature-rich, and user-friendly self-hosted web-based AI chat interface designed for offline operation. It supports various LLM runners, including Ollama and OpenAI-compatible APIs.
- **Stable Diffusion WebUI:** Automatic1111's Stable Diffusion WebUI is a web-based application that makes it easy to generate stunning images using the Stable Diffusion algorithm. As one of the most popular GUIs for SD image generation, it offers a wide range of features that improve style and quality with minimal processing impact. With support for multiple models, text prompts, and export options in various formats, Stable Diffusion WebUI is a powerful tool for creating impressive images.
- **SwarmUI:** This is a new modular Stable Diffusion web-based image generation interface that emphasizes making AI image generation power tools easily accessible, performant, and extensible. In our opinion, it is easier to get started with SwarmUI than other interfaces like Automatic1111's WebUI or ComfyUI.
