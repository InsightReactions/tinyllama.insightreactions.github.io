## Guiding Principles

Our development is guided by these Three Pillars:

### 1. Open Source Software

Harnessing the power of open source to drive innovation, empowerment, and accessibility, we offer free and effortless access to a well-maintained open-source platform of growing repository of cutting-edge AI technologies, including state-of-the-art image diffusion and large language models.

### 2. Privacy and Local Computing

Your privacy and data security are our top priorities. By promoting local computing, all data generated and used by the system stays on your device, ensuring complete control over your information. Our platform supports mDNS server auto-discovery, making it easy to access via your favorite mobile browser.

### 3. Accessibility and Affordability

We believe AI should be accessible to everyone, regardless of budget. Our Tiny Llama AI Home Server is an affordable, pre-configured Mini-ITX PC that allows users to host their own Tiny Llama service effortlessly and cost-effectively. It's designed for non-technical users familiar with generative AI technologies who prefer the privacy of local computing.

## The Tiny Llama Service

The Tiny Llama service includes:

* Pre-packaged AI WebUI software for seamless use on any device
* Effortless access to continuously updated open-source AI technologies
* A home portal for easy access to all web apps
* Pre-installed premium content like powerful and popular AI models, how-to guides, and more

## Hardware Specifications

Our hardware specifications ensure robust performance, capable of generating more than 55 tokens per second with Meta's Llama3-8b and supporting models up to 13b parameters (quantized). Visit the [InsightReactions Store](https://insightreactions.com/store) for more information.
