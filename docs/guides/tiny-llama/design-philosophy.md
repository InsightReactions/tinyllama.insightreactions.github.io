## Guiding Principles

Our development is guided by these Three Pillars:

### 1. Open Source Software

Harnessing the power of open source to drive innovation, empowerment, and accessibility, we offer free and effortless access to a well-maintained open-source platform of growing repository of cutting-edge AI technologies, including state-of-the-art image diffusion and large language models.

### 2. Privacy and Local Computing

Your privacy and data security are our top priorities. By promoting local computing, all data generated and used by the system stays on your device, ensuring complete control over your information. Our platform supports mDNS server auto-discovery, making it easy to access via your favorite mobile browser.

### 3. Accessibility and Affordability

We believe AI should be accessible to everyone, regardless of budget. Our Tiny Llama AI Home Server is an affordable, pre-configured Mini-ITX PC that allows users to host their own Tiny Llama service effortlessly and cost-effectively. It's designed for non-technical users familiar with generative AI technologies who prefer the privacy of local computing.
