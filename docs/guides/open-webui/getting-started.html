                <h3 id="resolving-account-issues">Resolving Account Issues</h3>
                <p>If someone else has already created an account on this device, you may encounter a message indicating
                    that an account activation is pending. In this case, the original account holder (listed as
                    &quot;Admin&quot;) must log in and approve your new account to grant access. To resolve this issue,
                    follow our <a href="#account-activation">Account Activation</a> procedure.</p>
                <h2 id="account-activation">Account Activation</h2>
                <p>Follow these steps to activate an account.</p>
                <h3 id="access-the-administrator-panel">Access the Administrator Panel</h3>
                <p>Log in to Open WebUI with the administrator account (usually the first account created). Click on
                    your profile icon and select &quot;Admin Panel&quot;.</p>
                <p><img src="admin_panel_location.png"

                        alt="Open WebUI Admin Panel Promote User screen"></p>
                <p>From the Admin Panel, locate the user account with a pending role. Click on the &quot;pending&quot;
                    role to change it to the &quot;user&quot; role.</p>
                <p>If you want to grant additional permissions, click on the &quot;user&quot; role again to promote the
                    account to the &quot;admin&quot; role. This will allow the user to access the Admin Panel and other
                    configuration settings associated with Open WebUI.</p>
                <h2 id="how-to-chat">How to Chat</h2>

                        alt="Open WebUI Chat screen"></p>
                <p>To start a new conversation, click on the &quot;New Chat&quot; button in the top-left corner of the
                    Open WebUI interface once you're logged in.</p>
                <h3 id="step-2-selecting-a-model">Step 2: Selecting a Model</h3>
                <p>From here, you can choose a model best suited to your task. By default, llama3 is selected, which is
                    a great generalist model suitable for many day-to-day tasks. For more information on the purposes of
                    other models, see our <a href="#model-selection">Model Selection</a> section.</p>
                <h3 id="step-3-sending-messages">Step 3: Sending Messages</h3>
                <p>To send a message, type it into the message field at the bottom of the window. You can also upload
                    documents for reference during the conversation by clicking on the &quot;+&quot; icon on the left
                    side of the message bar.</p>
                <p>Note that due to memory limitations, Tiny Llama is limited to a 2048 token context window, which is
                    roughly equivalent to 1,500 words in total, including the entirety of the conversation. In many
                    cases, it's preferable to only copy and paste relevant sections of a document.</p>
                <h3 id="step-4-submitting-messages">Step 4: Submitting Messages</h3>
                <p>Once you've entered a message, click the up arrow to submit it to the LLM (Large Language Model).</p>
                <h3 id="important-note">Important Note</h3>
                <p>Please wait ten to fifteen seconds for the model to load into memory. Once loaded, the delay will be
                    shortened to a couple of seconds. The model will stay loaded in memory and waiting for responses for
                    up to five minutes before freeing up that memory for other tasks.</p>
                <h2 id="model-selection">Model Selection</h2>
                <p>To select a model, click on the model name at the top of the chat window. You can choose from several
                    options, and you can even select multiple models simultaneously to compare their responses.</p>
                <h3 id="available-models">Available Models</h3>
                <p>By default, Tiny Llama ships with these models available for selection:</p>
                <h4 id="llama3">llama3</h4>
                <p>A generalist model developed by Meta, suitable for many day-to-day tasks. Llama 3 instruction-tuned
                    models are fine-tuned and optimized for dialogue/chat use cases, outperforming many open-source chat
                    models on common benchmarks.</p>
                <h4 id="hermes-2-theta-llama-3">hermes-2-Theta-llama-3</h4>
                <p>An experimental merged model from Nous Research, offering uncensored conversations without content
                    filters or ethical guidelines. This makes it ideal for highly creative endeavors and prompt
                    suggestions, such as roleplay.</p>
                <h4 id="llava-phi3">llava-phi3</h4>
                <p>An LMM (Large Multi-modal Model) capable of reading/writing text and visual interpretation of image
                    content. This model is great for transcribing text from images or basic scene interpretation.
                    Ideally, it should used in conjunction with other models like llama3 for the best experience, as its
                    visual component may detract the model from higher-quality reading and conversational comprehension.

                <h3 id="using-lmms-for-image-inference">Using LMMs for Image Inference</h3>
                <p><img src="image_request.png"
                        alt="Open WebUI image inference workflow"></p>
                <p>To perform image inference, follow these steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Select a large multi-modal model capable of image inference, such as llava-phi3.</li>
                    <li>Attach the image to the message box by either copying and pasting an image or clicking on the
                        &quot;+&quot; icon and selecting &quot;Upload Files&quot;.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><img src="image_response.png"
                        alt="Open WebUI image inference response"></p>
                <h3 id="important-note-1">Important Note</h3>
                <p>Keep in mind that while these models are improving every day, they're not perfect yet. However, you
                    can still get great assistance with interpreting textual content like labels or mixed-media images
                    that contain both text and image data. The more context you provide the model upfront, the better it
                    will be at understanding the scene and providing a helpful response.</p>
                <h2 id="image-generation-via-chat">Image Generation via Chat</h2>
                <h3 id="generating-images-with-dreamshaperxl-and-llms">Generating Images with DreamShaperXL and LLMs
                </h3>
                <p>Tiny Llama is configured for image generation inference by default, using DreamShaperXL as its
                    partner model. To generate an image with the assistance of your favorite Large Language Model (LLM),
                    follow these steps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>Choose an LLM to collaborate with on your image generation journey. llama3 is a suitable
                            choice for most tasks.
                            <img src="image_gen_prompt.png"
                                alt="Open WebUI image generation prompt">
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Provide a specific caption prompt, including adequate context to help the model understand
                            the task.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Once you've written and edited the caption as needed, click the image icon to submit it to
                            SwarmUI.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Wait for the image generation process to complete. The generated image will appear above the
                            prompt. You can regenerate the image as many times as desired. If the caption doesn't quite
                            meet your expectations, feel free to edit the LLM's response using the pen icon or
                            regenerate the response and try again.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p><img src="image_gen_response.png"
                        alt="Open WebUI image generation icon"></p>
                <h3 id="important-note-2">Important Note</h3>
                <p>The initial image generation may take up to 45 seconds depending on system utilization. Subsequent
                    generations typically complete within 10-20 seconds, as the image model remains in memory for up to
                    one minute. After a minute, the image is unloaded to make room for other models.</p>
