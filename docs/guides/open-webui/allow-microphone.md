## Why Is Microphone Access Disabled by Default?

By default, browsers have security measures that block websites from accessing your microphone without explicit permission. Only enable microphone access if you're using the application within your local network or a VPN due to potential privacy risks when accessed over public networks.

Configuring this will depend on your specific browser and operating system. To make the microphone work, you need to configure your browser to treat the website as secure (https).

### Example: Microsoft Edge
Here is an example of how to allow microphone access in Microsoft Edge, with a placeholder for the IP address:
1. In Edge, type `edge://flags/` into the URL bar and press Enter.
2. Search for "Insecure origins treated as secure".
3. Enter the IP address to your Tiny Llama instance (e.g., `http://192.168.0.52:8080`) in the text box next to this option, then click Enable. Note: You must include "http" at the beginning of the URL and specify port ":8080".
4. Restart Edge for changes to take effect.
