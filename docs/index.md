## [Stable Diffusion WebUI](guides/stable-diffusion-webui/index.html)

SAutomatic1111's Stable Diffusion WebUI is a web-based application that makes it easy to generate stunning images using the Stable Diffusion algorithm. As one of the most popular GUIs for SD image generation, it offers a wide range of features that improve style and quality with minimal processing impact. With support for multiple models, text prompts, and export options in various formats, Stable Diffusion WebUI is a powerful tool for creating impressive images.

## [SwarmUI](guides/swarmui/index.html)

This is a new modular Stable Diffusion web-based image generation interface that emphasizes making AI image generation power tools easily accessible, performant, and extensible. In our opinion, it is easier to get started with SwarmUI than other interfaces like Automatic1111's WebUI or ComfyUI.
